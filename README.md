Hello guys, this is Rohit, currently a sophomore at NIT Raipur, studying majors in IT. 

### ABOUT THIS PROJECT.
1. I've made a simple news homepage and I've chosen to take the small challenge from [frontend.io].
2. For making this project, I've used HTML and CSS. Apart form these two, I've also used "Bootstrap".
3. The website is fully responsive.
